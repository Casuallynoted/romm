# Installation

To start using RomM, check out the [Quick Start Guide][docs-quick-start-guide] in the docs. If you are having issues with RomM, please review the page for [troubleshooting steps][docs-troubleshooting] and common issues, or join the [Discord][discord-invite] for support from the community.

# Configuration

## Configuration File

RomM's "understanding" of your library can be configured with a `config.yaml` file or through the `config` tab in the `Control Panel` under the `Settings` section. Refer to the [example config.yml][configuration-file-example] file for guidance on how to configure it and the [example docker-compose.yml][docker-compose-example] file on how to mount it into the container.

## Scheduler

The scheduler allows you to schedule async tasks that run in the Redis container at regular intervals. Jobs can be run at a specific time in the future, after a time delta, or at recurring internals using cron notation. The [docs page on the scheduler][docs-scheduled-tasks] has more information on which tasks are available and how to enable them.

# Naming Convention

## Platform Support

If you adhere to the [RomM folder structure][folder-structure], RomM supports all platforms listed on the [Supported Platforms][docs-supported-platforms] page. **The folder is case-sensitive and must be used exactly as it appears on the list.** When scanning your library, RomM will use the folder name to determine the platform and fetch the appropriate game information, metadata, and cover art.

## Tag Support

Games can be tagged with region, revision, or other tags by using parentheses in the file name. Additionally, you can set the region and language by adding a prefix: (USA), [reg-J], (French), [De].

- Revision tags must be prefixed with **"rev "** or **"rev-"** (e.g. **(rev v1)** or **(rev-1)**)
- Other tags will also be imported, for example: **my_game [1.0001]\(HACK\)[!].gba**

Tags can be used to search for games in the search bar. For example, searching for **(USA)** will return all games with the USA tag.
